## Developer Interview Exam

##### This is the readme.md file for the Developer Interview Exam for C.D.

##### 

### Slice PSD and Build Out Local Site

##### Take the PSD called ZWave_Desktop.psd and slice the design to build out a local copy of the
website. A desktop version is the only design comp provided but it is expected that you build out
the site responsively and use your own best judgement to accommodate all elements in the
design as the screen/device size gets smaller. You can choose to use a framework such as
Bootstrap or Foundation or custom code the entire template. Please make sure to toggle the
invisible layers in the PSD for the “Browse” mega menu and for the toggled state of the site
search.

### JavaScript and jQuery

#### Using the template built out in the first step implement the following:

##### 1. Create a lightbox login form upon clicking on the “Log In” button on the template.
This form should have validation to make sure both email address and password
are entered. In addition, the validation should verify an email address has been
entered in a valid format and the password contains more than 6 characters.
Upon successful validation simulate a form submission that stores the email
address into local storage, refreshes the local site, updates the log in button to
say “Account” and outputs the stored email address on the page.
