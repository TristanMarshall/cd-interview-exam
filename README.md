 -### Instructions		
 -		
 -#### Slice PSD and Build Out Local Site		
 -		
 -##### Take the PSD called ZWave_Desktop.psd and slice the design to build out a local copy of the		
 -website. A desktop version is the only design comp provided but it is expected that you build out		
 -the site responsively and use your own best judgement to accommodate all elements in the		
 -design as the screen/device size gets smaller. You can choose to use a framework such as		
 -Bootstrap or Foundation or custom code the entire template. Please make sure to toggle the		
 -invisible layers in the PSD for the “Browse” mega menu and for the toggled state of the site		
 -search.		
 -		
 -#### JavaScript and jQuery		
 -		
 -#### Using the template built out in the first step implement the following:		
 -		
 -##### 1. Create a lightbox login form upon clicking on the “Log In” button on the template.		
 -This form should have validation to make sure both email address and password		
 -are entered. In addition, the validation should verify an email address has been		
 -entered in a valid format and the password contains more than 6 characters.		
 -Upon successful validation simulate a form submission that stores the email		
 -address into local storage, refreshes the local site, updates the log in button to		
 -say “Account” and outputs the stored email address on the page.
